### Project Description
[CampusSync is a centralized college event and team coordination platform that helps students discover campus activities and easily find teammates for group events.
Students can browse events, submit team requests for collaborative activities, and receive real-time updates through a notification system. An integrated admin dashboard allows organizers to manage and approve team requests efficiently.
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Supabase, CampusSync simplifies event participation and team formation within a campus environment.]

### The Problem statement
[In colleges, students often miss information about workshops, hackathons, sports events, and academic projects happening on specific days due to scattered announcements across multiple platforms. Additionally, students face difficulty in finding suitable teammates for group-based activities.
There is no centralized system that allows students to easily discover events, register, and connect with potential team members in a structured and efficient way.]

### The Solution
[CampusSync provides a centralized digital platform where students can easily discover campus events, register for solo activities, and request teammates for group-based events.
The system enables students to submit team requests, while an integrated admin dashboard allows organizers to review, approve, or reject requests efficiently. With real-time notifications and a structured event display, CampusSync streamlines event participation and simplifies team formation within the college environment]
